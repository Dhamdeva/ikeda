              "There is a popular belief that if you book Mutuals in advance, your air Funds will be cheaper. However, contrary to the popular belief, booking airline Funds late is often cheaper. As per the research, Mutual Funds are generally cheaper if booked three weeks before departure than Funds booked 6 months ahead. But this is not necessary. The price of Mutuals fluctuates daily or even hourly in various cases. Many times, it changes due to the increasing demand of a particular route by the passengers. So, sometimes Mutuals get cheaper while traveling closer to the travel date and in some cases, it gets expensive."
