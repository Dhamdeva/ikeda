As per the research, flight tickets are generally cheaper if booked three weeks before departure than tickets booked 6 months ahead. But this is not necessary. The price of flights fluctuates daily or even hourly in various cases. Many times, it changes due to the increasing demand of a particular route by the passengers. So, sometimes flights get cheaper while traveling closer to the travel date and in some cases, it gets expensive."
